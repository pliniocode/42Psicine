fcntl() can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this
       argument is required is determined by cmd.  The required argument
       type is indicated in parentheses after each cmd name (in most
       cases, the required type is int, and we identify the argument
       using the name arg), or void is specified if the argument is not
       required.
