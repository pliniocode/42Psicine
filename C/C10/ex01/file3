FILE 3
Description
read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.
On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at the current file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes read. If the current file offset is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.
