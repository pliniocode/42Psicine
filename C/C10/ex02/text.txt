Description
read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor 
fd into the buffer starting at buf.
On files that support seeking, the read operation commences at 
the current file offset, 
and the file offset is incremented by the number of bytes read. 
If the current file offset 
is at or past the end of file, no bytes are read, and read() 
returns zero.

fcntl() can take an optional third argument.  Whether or not this
argument is required is determined by cmd.  The required argument
type is indicated in parentheses after each cmd name (in most
cases, the required type is int, and we identify the argument
using the name arg), or void is specified if the argument is not
 required.
